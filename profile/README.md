# It depends — strategic social data science

_Helping companies and organisations navigate complexity_

**Our principles**

Data science is too powerful to leave to engineers. Crafting metrics that meaningfully capture human behaviour while remaining relevant to decision-makers requires an interdisciplinary perspective.

Working at the intersection of social research, data science, and business strategy, we are 𝘴𝘰𝘤𝘪𝘢𝘭 𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘢 𝘴𝘤𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘴.

This is how we make elusive social phenomena tangible: by chasing actionable explanations rather than mindless modelling.

**Our procedure**

1. Understand the strategic context of the challenge.
2. Build a robust research design from clear conceptual thinking.
3. Discover solutions through computational pattern recognition and human interpretation.

**Our people**

Working with us means collaborating directly with our founding partners. We dedicate a small, high-performing team to solving your challenge end to end.

Based in a former butcher's shop in the heart of Copenhagen, Denmark, our experts quantify human needs, attitudes, and desires across a range of industries worldwide.
